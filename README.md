Fancier Outlines for Python-Markdown
=====================================

This is a fork of [mdx_outline](https://github.com/aleray/mdx_outline) that adds the option of
inserting a "Jump to Top" link at the end of sections. See that project for general usage.
Currently this works with the default settings of mdx\_outline, but it will probably break
for non-default settings.
